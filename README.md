# resource_website_frontend
A website for all college related resources from notes to question papers under one roof

for frontend to run you need [backend](https://github.com/BitByte-TPC/resource_website_backend) firsrt.
So go there and follow the steps then come back and continue

for frontend we use ReactJs and bootstrap.

here is a look at our current progress and design for this site.
If you have any suggestion on improvement feel free to open an issue.

## Installation

for installation it's pretty simple after initialising the serve,
just open another terminal window and clone and enter the repo.

after that type command

```bash
npm install
```
to download all the dependencies.

then to start the frontend server just type

to start our react app.
